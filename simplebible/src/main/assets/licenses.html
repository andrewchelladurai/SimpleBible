    we ask is that if you CHANGE the actual text of the World English Bible in any way, you not call
    the result the World English Bible any more. This is to avoid confusion, not to limit your
    freedom. The Holy Bible is God's Word. It belongs to God. He gave it to us freely, and we who
    have worked on this translation freely give it to you by dedicating it to the Public Domain.</p>
