<p>Let me begin by saying, <strong>“I am thankful and grateful to you”</strong> for using this
  application. It means the application is helpful at atleast one person and I hope it serves a more
  meaningful purpose than a simple reference to the Holy Bible.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong><em>Simple Bible</em> intends to be easy to use &amp; avoid unnecessary
  features.</strong><br/><br/> These were the two most common requests the elders I knew wished in
  the Bible applications they used on their phones. So began my task and this is my second attempt
  to meet their needs.</p></blockquote>

<p>For <strong>suggestions, feedback or anything else</strong>, use the <code>"Email
  Developer"</code> option on the Settings screen.</p>

<p>This is an Open Source application, you can find the source code hosted on <a
  href="http://github.com/andrewchelladurai/"
>Github here</a>.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Credit and Recognition</strong><br/> I am indebted to the users who have contacted me
  regarding this application and shared their opinions and thoughts. I truly appreciate it.</p>
