<h1 id="simplebible">SimpleBible</h1>
<p>An Offline Android Bible application with easy navigation. The translation used is a public domain one <strong>The World Bible - British Edition</strong> . The application has limited features by choice to avoid confusing elders who use Smartphones and find it confusing or difficult to use.</p>
<p>This is a work in progress  : <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Andrew+Chelladurai%22">Developer Account on Google Play</a></p>
<p>I plan to work on the application as and when time permits, however it is proving difficult with a day job and other things considered. However I will continue working on the appliation and consider all feedback I may receive.</p>
